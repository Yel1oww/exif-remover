PROGRAM: Exif Remover
AUTHOR:  Yel1oww
PURPOSE: A privacy-focused tool that "sanitizes" images by stripping all 
         metadata, leaving only the raw pixel data to prevent OSINT tracking.

# You can now run your 'exif-extractor.py' on the new file 
# to confirm that 'Found 0 metadata entries' is the result.
